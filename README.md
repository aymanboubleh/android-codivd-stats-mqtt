# mqttApp
The following app was developed as a part of an IoT Big Data project to collect useful information about users.
Credits to **lamhoangx**,which is the developer of the app we built our sensor layer on top of and adapted  so it starts logging sensor information instead. 

This app allows you to establish a connection to a MQTT broker and send messages containing device sensor information to specific topics.

A demo is available here https://youtu.be/WOLmTDeXj7c
